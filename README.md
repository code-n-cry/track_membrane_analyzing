<b>Track membranes analyzing</b><br>

<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_track" target="_blank">Track membranes(wiki link)</a></b> are damage-trails created by swift heavy ions penetrating through solids, which may be sufficiently-contiguous for chemical etching in a variety of crystalline, glassy, and/or polymeric solids.

<b>The task was:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>
    To develop neural network that will recognize correct and wrong holes in the membrane.</li>
  <li>To develop programm that will find every hole in big membrane image and get it ready to analyze</li>
  <li>Create an dataset to train neural network</li>
  <li>Create GUI to this programm that will show percentage of correct and wrong holes and also show every hole diameter</li>
  </ul>
<b>I have done:</b>
<ul><li>first, second and third points</li></ul>

<b>Used technologies:</b>
<ul>
  <li>TensorFlow</li>
  <li>Keras</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>PIL</li>
</ul>

<b>Dataset.zip</b> is an directory with two subdirectories (that are "correct" and "wrong") that contains in to total 11000 photos of different holes<br>
<b>Test.zip</b> is an directory that contains some photos that you can use to check programm's working.
